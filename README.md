# SyndicationFeed

It's a pet project which demonstrates a Web API server in ASP.NET Core.

The server API provides a functionality to group several feeds (e. g. RSS or Atom)
into a single collection, and allows access to the whole collection.

The project defines SDK for clients as well as a test app.
